Create a User in Linux without a home directory

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App 3 in Stratos Datacenter.


Create a user named john in App Server 3 without a home directory.

1. sudo useradd -M john

2. getent passwd | grep john
