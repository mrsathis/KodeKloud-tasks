Linux User Expiry

Question:

A developer javed has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for javed. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.


Therefore, create a user named javed on the App Server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-04-15 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

Answer:

    1  sudo adduser javed
    2  sudo chage -E 2021-04-15 javed
    3  sudo chage -l javed
