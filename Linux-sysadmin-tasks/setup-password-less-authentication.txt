Set up a password-less authentication

Question:

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users. Based on the requirements, perform the following:


Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.



Login to all the app servers and create authorized_keys file in specific users .ssh home directory as shown below -
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Change the permission of file to 600
Now on jump_host generate the keys using command - ssh-keygen -t rsa
Note - Just press enter for every question asked.
Finally scp the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from jump_host to all the app servers as shown below using respective passwords.
Example - scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub tony@stapp01:/home/tony/.ssh/authorized_keys
With above steps , you will be able to set the passwordless ssh from jump_host server for user thor to all the stapp server respective users.


ssh tony@stapp01	Ir0nM@n

ssh steve@stapp02	Am3ric@

ssh banner@stapp03	BigGr33n



cat /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh banner@stapp03 ‘cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys’

ssh banner@stapp03 "chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys"
