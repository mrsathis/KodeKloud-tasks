Install and Configure Web Application

xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in -progress, but we want to get the servers ready. The storage server has a shared directory /data that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:


a. Install httpd package and dependencies on all app hosts.

b. Apache should serve on port 8080 within the apps.

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/blog and /home/thor/games on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that blog should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/blog/ and games should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/games. (do not worry about load balancer configuration, as its already configured).

d. You can access the website on LBR link; to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select the option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.
