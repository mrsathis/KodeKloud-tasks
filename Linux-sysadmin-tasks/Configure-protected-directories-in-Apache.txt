Configure protected directories in Apache

Question:

xFusionCorp Industries has hosted several static websites on Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos DC. There are some confidential directories on document root that need to be password protected. Because they are using Apache for hosting the websites, the production support team has decided to use .htaccess with basic auth. There is a website that needs to be uploaded to /var/www/html/devops on Nautilus App Server 1. However, we need to set up the authentication before that.


Create /var/www/html/devops direcotry if doesn't exist.

Add a user javed in htpasswd and set its password to YchZHRcLkL.

There is a file /tmp/index.html placed on Jump Server. Copy the same to new directory you created, please make sure default document root should remain /var/www/html. Also website should work on URL http://<app-server-hostname>:<port>/devops

Answer:

	1  id
    2  cd /var/www/html/devops
    3  cd /var/www/html/
    4  ls -l
    5  mkdir devops
    6  ls -l
    7  cd devops/
    8  pwd
    9  sudo htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd javed ==> you will be prompted to enter password.
   10  sudo systemctl status httpd
   11  sudo systemctl start httpd
   12  sudo systemctl restart httpd
   13  cd /etc/httpd/conf/
   14  sudo vi httpd.conf 
   15  cd /var/www/html/devops/
   16  vi .htaccess
   17  cd /tmp/
   18  ls -l
   19  mv index.html /var/www/html/devops/
   20  curl -u javed http://localhost:8080/devops
   21  curl -u javed http://localhost:8080/devops/index.html ==> the password you set has to be entered.
