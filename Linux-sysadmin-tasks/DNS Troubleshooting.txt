DNS Troubleshooting

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.


As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.


ssh tony@stapp01  #App Server 1  Ir0nM@n

sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

Insert these lines below "search stratos.xfusioncorp.com"

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
