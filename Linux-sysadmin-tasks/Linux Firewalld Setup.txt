Linux Firewalld Setup

Question:

To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx services running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Apache. We might have more robust firewall settings in the future, but for now we have decided to go with the given requirements listed below:


a. Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port.

b. Allow incoming connections from LB host only on Apache port and block for all others.

c. All rules must be permanent.

d. Zone should be public.

e. If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already, please make sure to start them.

Answers:

1. At first login on App server  ssh tony@stapp01

2. Switch to  root user : sudo su -

3. Run Below command to check the existing Apache httpd & Nginx service status.

     systemctl status httpd &&  systemctl status nginx

4. Get the Apache & Nginx Listen port  by using the below command

    grep -i Listen /etc/httpd/conf/ht*  /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

5.  Now Install Firewalld : yum install -y firewalld

6. Start the firewalld service , Enable and Check the status 

systemctl start firewalld && systemctl enable firewalld && systemctl status firewalld  

7. Allow the nginx port

 ( Please make sure, you use  nginx port, refer Point 4. Above)

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8096/tcp

9. Allow the Apache http  port  with LB host IP

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" \ source address=172.16.238.14 port protocol=tcp port=8083 accept'

10. Reload firewalld service to take effect & validate the rules

firewall-cmd --reload && systemctl restart firewalld && firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
