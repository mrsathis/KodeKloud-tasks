Docker Networking:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

None:
~~~~~
- container cannot connect any network and no one connect this container

- docker run --network none nginx

Host:
~~~~~

- Container created with host shares the same network of host.

- There is no network isolation between host and container.

- docker run --network host nginx

- If a container hosts a web application on port 80 of host, then similar application on containers on the same host can't use that port.

Bridge:
~~~~~~~

- Internal private network gets created in the host.

- The default network ip address is 172.17.0.0 and the ceach device or containers connecting to this bridge gets its own ip address from this network.

How is this bridge network created in Docker?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Once docker gets installed, it installs the internal private network called bridge in the host.

- Inside the container, it installs as bridge and can be seen in >> docker network ls

- In host it will show as "docker0" and to check this docker network from the host use command >> ip link and it will show the network interface as "docker0"

- during the install, docker runs the command, ip link add docker0 type bridge 

- Whenever the container gets created, network namespace for the container gets created.
